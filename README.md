# THOJ

Tommy-Harry Online Judge (THOJ) is a web application for problem/contest hosting and judging code written by Tommy Shan and Harry Xu for the ICS3U6 Computer Science course at Richmond Hill High School.

## Inspiration

The students/teachers at RHHS usually need to go through a quite complicated process in order to host a contest. Therefore, THOJ was developed for the purpose of providing students and teachers with a convenient place to host a contest.

## What It Does?
 * Host local contests in the RHHS community.
 * Validate and judge the code for the problem that's uploaded on THOJ.
 * Allow users to discuss the problems through the discussion section and comments.
 * Recommend similar problems to the currently selected problem.
 * Problem filter the problems based on the given conditions.

## Features
 * A multithreaded web server with a custom design inspired by Spring Boot, Angular, and NestJS.
 * A custom templating language heavily inspired by Svelte and EJS.
 * An asset and template engine to hold and compile assets and templates.
 * A class to compile, run, and test submitted Java code in a background thread.
 * A filter to prevent malicious code from being inserted into submitted code.
 * A backend database with SQLite to allow for data persistence.

## What We Are Demonstrating?
 * Class Hierarchy
 * Object-Oriented Programming and Design
 * Front-End Website Development (HTML, JS, CSS)
 * Back-End Website Development (Java)
 * Algorithm Design and Implementation (e.g. Graph Theory, String Matching, Password Hashing)
 * Database (SQLite)

## What's Next for THOJ?
 * Improve features to provide users with a better user experience.
 * Complete additional features to convenience users.
 * Add contests and comments
 * Allow users to upload their own problems
 * Upload more problems to the judge
 * Promote the website to the RHHS community.
