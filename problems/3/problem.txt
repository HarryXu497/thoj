Mr. Choi is Disappointed?
Implementation

Tommy is doing computer science in calculus class when his teacher, Mr. Choi, calls him up to do a problem on the board.

He needs to transpose a matrix (flip across $y = x$). Luckily Tommy has prepared for this exact situation, and he built a program to do it for him. Unfortunately, Tommy forgot his laptop at home. He now needs you to write it for him. Can you do it?

An integer, $N$, is inputted on the first line.

Following that, a $N$-by-$N$ matrix is inputted as $N$ space-separated integers on $N$ lines.

Transpose the matrix!

** Note: A new line at the end of the program is expected.

## Sample Input
```
4
4 7 2 9
6 2 5 7
4 2 8 0
8 4 9 1
```

## Sample Output
```
1 0 7 9
9 8 5 2
4 2 2 7
8 4 6 4
```
