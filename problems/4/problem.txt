Mr. Mangat is marking some code for computer science. Howver, he is easily bored and he wants to mark unique sections of code.

To be entertained for the longest time, he asks you to write a program to determine the length of the longest substring with unique characters in the code he is marking. Can you do it? Your mark depends on it.

** Note: A new line at the end of the program is expected.
